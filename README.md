Air Quality Report

1. Aim: The aim of this project is to visualize how key air pollutants such as, Carbon Monoxide (CO), Nitric Oxide (NO), Nitrogen Dioxide (NO₂), PM2.5, and PM10 affect the air quality across various cities in India, using data spanning from 2015 to 2020.
   
3. Objectives
   
i) Assess Pollutant Levels: Provide insights into the daily and yearly fluctuations of major pollutants.
ii) Identify Trends and Patterns: Use interactive visuals and time-series analysis to reveal seasonal or annual changes.
iii) Facilitate Informed Decisions: Help in designing targeted interventions, regulations, and initiatives to curb air pollution.
iv) Highlight Geographic Differences: Compare pollutant concentrations across different cities with maps and charts.

3. Target Audience

i) Policy Makers: Government bodies responsible for creating and enforcing regulations to improve air quality.
ii) Non Profit Organizations: Environmental and public health groups aiming to promote cleaner air and reduce pollution related health risks.
